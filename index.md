# Introduction

At Monkee-Boy, we aim to create quality websites that are fast, accessible, and provide the best user experience we can. This site stands as a guide to building projects as we achieve that goal. It contains best practices, potential tools, and lessons learned among the development team. That being said, the dev team is not a hive mind and you are a developer here because of your individual skills and creativity. We try to be descriptive in these guides around how we work/how we want to work but it's worth calling out that these are more what you call guidelines, than actual rules. We encourage debating things internally and projects will have inconsistencies.

We don't want you to get caught up in "is this the best way to handle this?". The goal here is to give us the best starting position we can have when building projects. As a developer on a project, it's up to you to take the best that's available and run with it. If there are things in this guide that you disagree with, submit a pull request or jump into Slack and lets chat as a team. Don't accept the status quo if you feel there is a better method or tool for all of us.

This is a living guide and will be updated as we continue to improve our process.
